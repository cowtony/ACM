# Data Structure & Algorithms Introduction
## Course objective:
- Have a brief knowledge of the fundamental of data structure and algorithm.
- Be able to prepare interviews for software engineer roles.
- Be able to prepare algorithm contests such as the one from USACO, ACM-ICPC, Leetcode, etc.
- This course will use mostly `easy` and few `medium` questions from Leetcode as practice or assignment.

## Prerequisite:
- Familiar with one of the programming language syntax: Python, C++, JAVA.

## Classes:
- Introduction; time and space complexity analysis.

**Data Structure:**
- Array, linked list, doubly linked list.
- Queue, stack.
- Tree, binary tree.
- Heap.
- Hash table.

**Algorithm:**
- Sort
- Binary search
- Recursion / Backtracking
