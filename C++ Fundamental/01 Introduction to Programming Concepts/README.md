# Prerequisit
Install a C++ compiler (like GCC) and an IDE (like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio).

  - Code::Blocks: https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp
  - Online IDE: https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/ 
- GitHub: https://github.com/cowtony/ACM/tree/master/C%2B%2B%20Fundamental

# Topics

- Feel free to stop me and ask questions.
- The goal of learning programming languages.
- What is programming? Why do we use programming languages, and why C++ specifically?
  - C++: Fastest, longest code, more error-prone. C++ 11, 14, 17, 21
  - Java: 
  - Python: Slowest, shortest code, shortest dev time. (Interpreted language)
- Set up the development environment.
- Discussion on the basic structure of a C++ program including header files, main function, and syntax.
- Introduction to primitive data types in C++:
  - integers
  - floating point numbers
  - characters
  - boolean
- Basic input/output using `cin` and `cout`.
- Basic operations: `+-*/`.

- Writing a simple C++ program: "Hello World".
- Writing a program to take input and calculate the sum.

# Homework
Use what we learnt today (premitive data types, input & output), write code to take some inputs, and output it with descriptive text. Please make sure to try different data types: `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`. For example:
- Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers and then calculates and prints their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.
