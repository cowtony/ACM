# Recap

- Function declaration

- Write a function to swap two numbers


# Pointer: `*` and `&`

- Get the address: `&` (reference operator)
- Get value: `*` (dereference operator)

```C++
int x = 10;
int* addr = &x;
int y = *x;
```

- pointer arithmetic
- Pointer of string / Array.
  - `main()` function actually can take input!
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
  - `new` and `delete`


# Reference: `&`

```C++
int x = 10;
int& y = x;
y = 5;
```

- Pointer & reference as function argument.
- Reference is actrually pointer behind it!

# Pracetise


# Assignment
- Try to use `Dynamic Memory Allocation` to write any one of the previous assignment.
- Make the string upper case (in-place).
- Double the value of an array.
- Bubble sort the array.
- Extra: Linked List Implementation. (Maybe after learned struct)
