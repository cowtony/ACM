Syllabus

# Class 1 - Introduction to Programming Concepts

- What is programming? Why do we use programming languages, and why C++ specifically?
- Overview of different types of programming languages - high-level, low-level, interpreted, and compiled languages.
- Discussion on the basic structure of a C++ program including header files, main function, and syntax.
- Introduction to basic data types in C++: integers, floating point numbers, characters, and booleans.
- Writing a simple C++ program: "Hello World".

## Homework
Install a C++ compiler (like GCC) and an IDE (like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio). Write, compile, and run the "Hello World" program. Experiment with outputting different text.

# Class 2 - Variables, Constants, and Basic Input/Output

- Explanation of what variables are and how they are used in C++.
- Constants and their usage.
- Basic input/output using `cin` and `cout`.
- Basic string manipulation and using the `getline` function.
- Overview of basic arithmetic operators.

## Homework
Write a program that asks the user for their name and age and prints a message with this information. Additionally, write a program that performs various arithmetic operations.

# Class 3 - Control Flow

- Introduction to conditional statements - if, else, else-if, and switch-case.
- Introduction to loop control structures - while, do-while, and for loops.
- Explanation of break and continue statements.

## Homework
Write a program that solves a basic problem, like determining if a number is even or odd, or grading system based on marks, using conditional statements. Create a program to print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci series using loops.

# Class 4 - Arrays and Strings
- Introduction to the concept of arrays and how to use them in C++.
- Manipulation of arrays.
- Introduction to C++ Strings, difference between C-style strings and C++ strings.
- Common string manipulation functions - length, append, insert, erase, substr etc.

## Homework
Write a program that calculates the average of an array of numbers. Write a program that performs various string operations like reversing a string, finding a substring, etc.

# Class 5 - Functions and Scope
- Definition and use of functions, function parameters and return values.
- Understanding local and global scope.
- Introduction to function overloading.

## Homework
Write a program that uses multiple functions to solve a problem, such as calculating the area of different geometric shapes.

# Class 6 - Pointers and References
- What are pointers and references? Why are they useful?
- Understanding pointer arithmetic.
- Use of pointers with arrays and functions.
- Introduction to dynamic memory allocation.

## Homework
Write a program using pointers to perform operations on array elements. Write a program that uses dynamic memory allocation to create an array of a size specified by the user.

# Class 7 - Structures and Enumerations
- Definition and use of structures.
- Use of structures in functions.
- Understanding and usage of enumerations.

## Homework
Write a program that uses structures to store and manipulate information about students (like name, age, and grades). Use enumerations to represent something like days of the week.

# Class 8 - Object-Oriented Programming
- Introduction to the concepts of classes and objects.
- Understanding constructors and destructors.
- Understanding access modifiers (public, private, protected) and their usage.
- Introduction to methods and attributes in classes.

## Homework
Design a class representing a simple concept (like a 'Student' or 'Car'), instantiate objects of the class, and manipulate these objects using methods.

# Class 9 - More about Object-Oriented Programming
- Understanding Inheritance - base classes, derived classes, and how to use inheritance to promote code reuse.
- Understanding Polymorphism - function overriding, virtual functions, and how polymorphism enables more flexible and dynamic behavior.
- Encapsulation and its importance in hiding data and maintaining integrity.
- Introduction to Abstract Classes and Interfaces.

## Homework
Write a program where a base class 'Animal' is inherited by a few derived classes like 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Bird' etc. Include common methods in the Animal class (like eat, sleep) and unique methods in the derived classes (like bark for Dog, meow for Cat etc.). Use polymorphism to call these methods dynamically.

# Class 10 - File I/O and Exception Handling
- Introduction to working with files - opening and closing files, reading from and writing to files.
- Understanding exceptions, how they are raised, and how to handle them using try, catch, and throw keywords.
- Demonstration of various I/O operations and exception handling through a practical example.

## Homework
Write a program that reads a file containing a list of numbers, calculates their average, and writes the result to a new file. Include exception handling to deal with potential errors like the file not being found, divide by zero errors, etc.
