# Reference


# Struct

```C++
struct StructName {
    int a;
    double b;
    char c;
};  // Don't forget the ';'
```

# Enum

`enum Color { red, green, blue };`

# Linked List

# Homework
Use the basic linked list written in class. Implement the following feature:

- Insert a node at the beginning of the list
- Insert a node at the end of the list (done)
- Delete a node from the list based on a given value, or a given index
  - Recursive?
- Print the linked list (done)
  - Reverse print the linked list Recursivly
- Get the length of the linked list

Extra:
- Doubly Linked List
- HARD: Reverse the linked list
  - Recursive?
