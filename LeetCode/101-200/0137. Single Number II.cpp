Consider the following fact:
Write all numbers in binary form, then for any bit 1 that appeared 3*n times (n is an integer), the bit can only present in numbers that appeared 3 times
e.g. 0010 0010 0010 1011 1011 1011 1000 (assuming 4-bit integers)
2(0010) and 11(1011) appeared 3 times, and digit counts are:

Digits 3 2 1 0

Counts 4 0 6 3

Counts%3 1 0 0 0

Counts on 2,1,0 are all times of 3, the only digit index that has Counts % 3 != 0 is 3
Therefore, to find the number that appeared only 1 or 2 times, we only need to extract all bits that has Counts %3 != 0

Now consider how we could do this by bit manipulation

since counts % 3 has only 3 states: 0(00),1(01),2(10)
we could use a TWO BIT COUNTER (Two, One) to represent Counts % 3, now we could do a little research on state transitions,
for each bit, let B be the input bit, we can enumerate the all possible state transitions,
Two+, One+ is the new state of Two, One. (here we need to use some knowledge in Digital Logic Design)

Two One B Two+ One+

0 0 0 0 0

0 0 1 0 1

0 1 0 0 1

0 1 1 1 0

1 0 0 1 0

1 0 1 0 0

1 1 0 X X (X represents we don't care)

1 1 1 X X

We could then draw the Karnaugh map to analyze the logic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map), and then we get:

One+ = (One ^ B) & (~Two)

Two+ = (~One+) & (Two ^ B)

Now for int_32, we need only 2 int_32 two represent Two and One for each bit and update Two and One using the rules derived above
