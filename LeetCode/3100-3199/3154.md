**Tl;Dr:** Insert operation_1 to slots between operation_2. Count the combinations. The number of operation_1 is deterministic based on number of operation_2.

This problem initially looks like dynamic programming but operation_1 (go backward) makes it more difficult to progress your DP array.

So another look at the two operations, and draw some provided examples to see if we can find more insights:

```
k = 0:
starting:    1
operation_2:    1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ...
operation_1:  -1 (stop here will get k = 1(start) - 1(op1) = 0)
operation_1:  -1 -1 (stop here will get k = 1(start) - 1(op1) + 1(op2) - 1(op1) = 0)
```

```
k = 1:
starting:    1
operation_2:    1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ...
operation_1:  (do nothing will get k = 1(start))
operation_1:  -1^ (stop after op2 will get k = 1(start) - 1(op1) + 1(op2) = 1)
operation_1:     -1 (stop here will get k = 1(start) + 1(op2) - 1(op1) = 1)
operation_1:  -1 -1 -1 (stop here will get k = 1(start) -1(op1) + 1(op2) - 1(op1) + 2(op2) - 1(op1) = 1)
```

Above emulate the provided examples of `k = 0` and `k = 1`. When you read the above graph, you should sum all values for `start`, `operation_2`, and `operation_1` to get your target `k`.

So now the problem is converted to: **Given a fixed number of op2, how many op1 combinations can we insert?**

1. The total steps contributed by op2 is `op2_val = 2 ^ op2`, here including the starting position 1 for ease.
2. The number of op1 can then be calculated by `op1 = k - op2_val`.
3. And our available slots for `op1` is equal to the `op2` we did because there is a constraint **no consecutive oq1**.
4. The combination for `op1` is then C(op2, op1).
    ```C++
    int C(int a, int b) {
        if (b > a || b < 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = a, j = 1; j <= b; i--, j++) {
            result *= i;
            result /= j;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```
   This helper function also considered the scenario where the slot is not enough (`b > a`) and op2_val itself is not enough to reach k (`b < 0`).
5. Finally enumerate all possible op2 we need to try, from 0 to where `op2_val` is too large that even using all slots of `op1` we can decrease to `k`.
    ```C++
    int waysToReachStair(int k) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int op2 = 1, op2_sum = 1; op2_sum - k <= op2; op2++, op2_sum *= 2) {
            result += C(op2, op2_sum - k);
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int waysToReachStair(int k) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int op2 = 1, op2_sum = 1; op2_sum - k <= op2; op2++, op2_sum *= 2) {
            result += C(op2, op2_sum - k);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    int C(int a, int b) {
        if (b > a || b < 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = a, j = 1; j <= b; i--, j++) {
            result *= i;
            result /= j;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
